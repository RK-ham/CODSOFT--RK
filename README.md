## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

### Process:
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical features
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated accuracy
- Visualized data using count plots and heatmaps

### Libraries Used:
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

---

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species based on their measurements.

### Process:
- Explored data visually using pair plots
- Separated features and labels
- Used a decision tree classifier
- Trained and tested the model
- Evaluated model accuracy

### Libraries Used:
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## Task 4: Sales Prediction using Advertising Data

Built a regression model to forecast sales based on TV, radio, and newspaper advertisement budgets.

### Process:
- Analyzed correlations between variables
- Trained a linear regression model
- Predicted sales values on test data
- Evaluated performance using R² score and MAE

### Libraries Used:
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn

## Final Note

Thanks to CodSoft for this internship opportunity. Throughout this 30-day program, I learned essential data science concepts, applied machine learning models, and improved my real-world problem-solving skills.

Each task includes:
- A Colab notebook (.ipynb)
- A demo video (hosted on YouTube as unlisted)
